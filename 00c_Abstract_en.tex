The goal of this bachelor thesis is to extend the \emph{Indico} software developed at CERN with a
freely available JavaScript framework. Such a framework allows browser-independent and more
efficient development than possible by using plain JavaScript. Indico is a web application to plan
and manage meetings, conferences and similar events. Besides managing those, it also allows
management and reservation of conference rooms.

At first the used technologies HTML and JavaScript are introduced. Then both the current,
Indico-specific, framework and various other frameworks are introduced and analyzed according to
certain criteria. Based on this analysis the advantages and disadvantages of migrating to one of
these frameworks are analyzed and a framework is chosen. By using this framework parts of Indico
will be migrated or modified.

The solution being worked out in this thesis is meant to be a basis for using commonly used
well-documented \emph{third party} code and a maintainable developer-friendly system, which will
additionally be more user-friendly.
